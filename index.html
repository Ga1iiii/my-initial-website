    <h1>We are all about Culture</h1>
    <h2>Culture is Life. Culture is Art. Culture is the Future</h2>
    <P>Culture is everything to me. I started doing culture when I was about 10 years old. 
       I started with acting in school plays and elevated to public speaking and doing poetry.
       Today I am a new and upcoming poet who strives to publish her own poetry book.
